                errors in this diagram ma1 is the mgmt interface and front0 is
                the connection to the the trident.

<p>
There three pieces to the FBOSS Wedge 40 switch:
<ul>
<li>The BMC (Board Management Controller) - this is a controller that runs an embedded linux and controls things like the fans and the power.
<li>The Microserver - an SOC (system-on-a-chip) machine with an atom processor and 120GB SSD running Linux. This is where the FBOSS agent runs, and the system you will have a shell on for these demos.
<li>The Broadcom Trident router and switch - this is the hardware router/switch which we program from FBOSS with the necessary routing and switching information.
</ul>

<p>
The BMC has a serial line to the microserver and can get serial on it, as well as powercycle it.</p>

<p>
The BMC and the microserver are connected by a usb line and each has a usbnet interface to the other.</p>

<p>
The microserver is connected to the Trident over a PCI bus which speaks a proprietary Broadcom protocol to configure it. That protocol is exposed via OpenNSL libraries and a proprietary kernel driver.</p>

<p>
The open-source FBOSS agent exposes a CLI and a thrift interface and converts that to the OpenNSL calls to program or query the Trident.</p>

<p>
The software stack looks like this:</p>
